## Troubleshooting
### Problem	                            ### Solution
"Tesseract is not installed"   ->	 Install it and add to system PATH
"No text could be extracted"	  ->  Ensure file is readable (good quality scan)
"App crashes on upload"	       ->  Check for file format and size
"Category doesn't match"	      ->  Fix it once â€” app will learn next time
